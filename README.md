Pet Adoption

Program imports a CSV file of pets to a hash table. The user can then search for a pet by the ID, Gender, Type, Name, and Location. 

Assumptions are: users will want to add, remove pets from the list as they are adopted, so these functions were added to the Hash class.

The program is extensible/scalable in that the difficulty in upgrading the program to increase the pet attributes, add additional classes for adoption customers, adoption objects can be accomplished without having to modify the entire program.

I ran out of time to complete a single search function that allows user to search for any combination of pet attributes.

Testing would entail creating functions in 'Main' or a separate class
